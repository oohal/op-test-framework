OpTestConsole
-------------

Generic interface for a host system console. This just specifies the interface.
Get a serial console and use it like an IPMI one. This basicly the same as
pxssh, but it works on things other than SSH Sessions too.

Most of the code in here is helpers for interacting with the system under
test (e.g. shell setup for pexpect, etc.

Connecting / Disconnecting from the actual console driver is handled by the
actual drivers which inherit off this.
